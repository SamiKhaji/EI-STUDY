## Getting Started

The Decorator Pattern allows behavior to be added to individual objects, dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class.

Scenario:
A coffee shop sells different types of coffee. Customers can add extra ingredients like milk, sugar, or whipped cream. The Decorator Pattern will allow adding these extras dynamically.
