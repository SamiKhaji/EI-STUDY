## Getting Started

A social media platform uses a Content Moderation System where different moderation services subscribe to updates on posts made by users. These services might include:
1.Profanity Detection: Detects and flags inappropriate language.
2.Image Moderation: Checks for sensitive or inappropriate images.
3.Spam Detection: Identifies potential spam content.
4.User Reporting: Allows users to report posts, triggering additional scrutiny.
Whenever a new post is created or updated, all the subscribed moderation services are notified and take their respective actions to either approve, flag, or reject the content.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
