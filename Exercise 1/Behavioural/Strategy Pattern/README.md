## Getting Started
The Strategy Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. The pattern lets the algorithm vary independently from the clients that use it.

Imagine a payment system that supports different payment methods (Credit Card, PayPal, 	Bank Transfer). Instead of having complex if-else conditions to choose between payment 	methods, you can use the Strategy Pattern to make the payment selection dynamic.
