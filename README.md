### Exercise 2: Problem Statements for Mini-projects
## Real-time Chat Application Programming Exercise
## Problem Statement
Create a simple real-time chat application where users can join different chat rooms or create their own chat rooms. Users should be able to
send and receive messages in real-time.
## Functional Requirements
1. Allow users to create/join chat rooms by entering a unique room ID.
2. Enable users to send and receive messages in real-time within a chat room.
3. Display a list of active users in the chat room.
4. Optional: Implement a private messaging feature between users.
5. Optional: Implement message history, so the chat persists even if the user leaves and rejoins.
## Key Focus
1. Behavioral Pattern: Use the Observer Pattern to notify clients of new messages or user activities.
2. Creational Pattern: Use Singleton to manage the state of the chat rooms.
3. Structural Pattern: Use the Adapter Pattern to allow the system to work with different types of client communication protocols
(WebSocket, HTTP, etc.).
4. OOP: Apply encapsulation, polymorphism, and inheritance effectively
