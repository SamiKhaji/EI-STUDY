## title-ADVANCED TECHNIQUES FOR DETECTING IMAGE AND DATA 
FORGERY
With the advancement of technology in the Digital World, various image forgery and data 
manipulation techniques have become increasingly sophisticated. Digital Images are critical evidence 
in criminal investigations, insurance claims and journalism[1]. A survey by LocalCircles claimed that 
out of 32,000 people, 30% reported that one in four videos they watch are fake[2]. Data Forgery with 
malicious intent can have adverse effects on politics, provide misinformation and may promote 
gender-based violence[3].We aim first to identify key parameters that indicate image manipulation 
like ELA(Error Level analysis), noise level patterns etc. Our study focuses on determining the 
tampered regions in an image using deep learning architectures and the key parameters listed above. 
We further plan to provide analysis in video forgery detection.
